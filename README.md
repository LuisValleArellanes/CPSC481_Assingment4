CS481_Final_Project (Vince Bjazevic, Matthew Nguyen, Luis Valle-Arellanes)

Understanding Feedforward Neural Network
In this assignment, you are required to build 3 Feedforward Neural Networks(FNNs) to simulate function
𝑦=7𝑥31−𝑥2⋅𝑥21⋅1−𝑒(𝑥1+1)𝑥21−𝑒𝑥2+1 
in range x1: +-10, x2: +-10
You need to have a different structure for each model you build.
